            <h2>Models</h2>
            <p>The model of a car is its design, in the context of the manufacturer's range or series of cars. Different
                models are distinguishable by technology, components, underpinnings, and/or style and appearance.

                The methods used to categorise cars into models differ significantly between manufacturers. Frequently,
                several different body variants are offered, depending on market demand; and when completing their
                'production lifespan', sufficiently successful models are usually followed by a new 'generation' of that
                model.

                The name of a model (range or series) is almost always trademarked, so that competing manufacturers
                cannot also use it (unless the owner permits it, for an agreed licence fee).

                A popular model can have a significantly valuable brand name, and manufacturers often take great care in
                fostering and maintaining the brand image of the models bearing the name, both in terms of key model
                characteristics, as well as the targeted market, and the expected or desired buyer's demographic.</p>

            <h2>Spare parts</h2>
            <p>A spare part, spare, service part, repair part, or replacement part, is an interchangeable part that is
                kept in an inventory and used for the repair or refurbishment of defective equipment/units. Spare parts
                are an important feature of logistics engineering and supply chain management, often comprising
                dedicated spare parts management systems.

                Spare parts are an outgrowth of the industrial development of interchangeable parts and mass production.

                In an industrial environment, spare parts are described in several manner to distinguish key features of
                various spare parts. The following describes spare part types and their typically functionality.

                1. Capital parts are spare parts which, although acknowledged to have a long life or a small chance of
                failure, would cause a long shutdown of equipment because it would take a long time to get a replacement
                for them. Capital parts are typically repaired or replaced during planned overhauls/scheduled
                inspections. As description implies, these Capital Parts are typically expensive and are depreciated
                over time.

                Examples of capital parts include pumps and motor sets used in industrial plants, or impeller or a rotor
                required for a pump or motor. This “spare” requirement would be determined by redundancy of equipment
                used in the industrial processes.

                2. Consumables can be divided into two groups:

                Operational consumables are typically consumed during operation and an example of these would be air
                filters, grease and lubricants, light bulbs, etc. (for a car, it would be washer fluid)
                Inspection consumables are typically replaced during planned overhauls/scheduled inspections and an
                example of these would be fan belt, gaskets, lube oil, oil filters, etc. (for a car, it would be engine
                oil or transmission oil)
                3. Inspection spares or outage spares typically refer to those spare parts used in conjunction with
                Capital Parts during planned overhauls/scheduled inspections and maybe reused but typically are not
                repairable and are discarded after removal from use if Inspection Spares are damaged. These Inspection
                Spares are sometimes mis-characterized as Capital spares (vs Capital Parts) and are also confounded with
                Inspection Consumables, which must be replaced at every inspection/outage. (an example of inspection
                spares would be bearings and mechanical seals, large bolts and nuts.)

                4. Operational spares typically refer to those spare parts that are used during operation of equipment
                and would not require planned overhauls/scheduled inspections to replace. In an industrial setting,
                operational spares would be gages, valves (solenoid, MOVs that are in redundancy), transmitters, I/O
                boards, small AC/DC power supplies, etc. (for a car, it would windshield wiper)

                Classification

                part.
                In logistics, spare parts can be broadly classified into two groups, repairables and consumables.

                Economically, there is a tradeoff between the cost of ordering a replacement part and the cost of
                repairing a failed part. When the cost of repair becomes a significant percentage of the cost of
                replacement, it becomes economically favorable to simply order a replacement part. In such cases, the
                part is said to be "beyond economic repair" (BER), and the percentage associated with this threshold is
                known as the BER rate. Analysis of economic tradeoffs is formally evaluated using Level of Repair
                Analysis (LORA).

                Repairable
                Main article: Repairable
                Repairable parts are parts that are deemed worthy of repair, usually by virtue of economic consideration
                of their repair cost. Rather than bear the cost of completely replacing a finished product, repairables
                typically are designed to enable more affordable maintenance by being more modular. That allows
                components to be more easily removed, repaired, and replaced, enabling cheaper replacement. Spare parts
                that are needed to support condemnation of repairable parts are known as replenishment spares .

                A rotable pool is a pool of repairable spare parts inventory set aside to allow for multiple repairs to
                be accomplished simultaneously, which can be used to minimize stockout conditions for repairable items.

                Consumable
                Main article: Consumables

                Art design from recycle spare parts (South Africa).
                Parts that are not repairable are considered consumable parts. Consumable parts are usually scrapped, or
                "condemned", when they are found to have failed. Since no attempt at repair is made, for a fixed mean
                time between failures (MTBF), replacement rates for consumption of consumables are higher than an
                equivalent item treated as a repairable part. Therefore, consumables tend to be lower-cost items.

                Because consumables are lower cost and higher volume, economies of scale can be found by ordering in
                large lot sizes, a so-called economic order quantity.</p>

            <p>The automotive industry comprises a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the design,
                development, manufacturing, marketing, selling, repairing, and modification of motor vehicles.It is one
                of the world's largest industries by revenue (from 16% such as in France up to 40% to countries like
                Slovakia).

                The word automotive comes from the Greek autos (self), and Latin motivus (of motion), referring to any
                form of self-powered vehicle.This term, as proposed by Elmer Sperry</p>
